    "    The while loop in Python is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. It allows you to perform iterative tasks and keep executing the code until the condition becomes false. The while loop is beneficial when you need to repeat a set of actions based on a condition that cannot be determined beforehand or when the number of iterations is not fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of the while loop is as follows:\n",
    "    while condition:\n",
    "    # Code block to be executed repeatedly\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Here's a detailed description of when and why to use the while loop with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Input Validation\n",
    "One common scenario for using a while loop is input validation. Suppose you want to take input from the user until they enter a valid value. You can use a while loop to keep asking for input until the user provides valid data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "        if age >= 0 and age <= 120:\n",
    "            break  # Break the loop if the input is valid\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Please enter a valid age between 0 and 120.\")\n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "         this example, the while True loop runs indefinitely until the user enters a valid age between 0 and 120. If the user enters an invalid age (not an integer or outside the specified range), the loop continues to prompt for input until a valid age is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Game Loop\n",
    "Another common use case for the while loop is creating game loops or interactive programs where you want to keep running the game logic or user interactions until a specific condition (e.g., game over) is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "game_over = False\n",
    "score = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while not game_over:\n",
    "    # Game logic and user interactions here\n",
    "    answer = input(\"Guess the word: \")\n",
    "    if answer == \"python\":\n",
    "        print(\"Correct!\")\n",
    "        score += 10\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Wrong answer. Try again!\")\n",
    "        score -= 5\n",
    "\n",
    "    if score < 0:\n",
    "        game_over = True\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Game Over. Your final score is:\", score)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the game loop continues to run until the user's score goes below zero. The user keeps guessing words, and their score is updated based on their answers. When the score becomes negative, the while loop exits, and the game is over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It is essential to ensure that the condition within the while loop eventually becomes false; otherwise, the loop will run indefinitely, resulting in an infinite loop, which could freeze the program or lead to other issues. Always ensure that the condition has a mechanism to change or exit the loop eventually.\n",
